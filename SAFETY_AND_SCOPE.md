## 5. EMERGENCY ESCALATION RULES

### 5.1 Red-Flag Conditions (Auto-Escalate to Human)

The system MUST immediately flag and escalate when detecting:

#### Cardiovascular Red Flags
- Chest pain with radiation, diaphoresis, or shortness of breath
- Sudden severe headache ("worst headache of my life")
- Unilateral weakness, facial droop, slurred speech (stroke symptoms)
- Syncope (loss of consciousness)
- Severe hypertension (>180/120 mmHg)

#### Respiratory Red Flags
- Severe shortness of breath at rest
- Stridor or audible wheezing with distress
- Cyanosis (blue discoloration)
- Respiratory rate >30 or <8 breaths/min

#### Neurological Red Flags
- Altered mental status or confusion
- New-onset seizures
- Severe head trauma with loss of consciousness
- Sudden vision loss

#### Gastrointestinal Red Flags
- Severe abdominal pain with rigidity (acute abdomen)
- Vomiting blood or blood in stool
- Signs of severe dehydration in children

#### Infectious Red Flags
- High fever (>104°F / 40°C) with altered mental status
- Signs of sepsis (fever + hypotension + tachycardia)
- Meningitis symptoms (fever + stiff neck + headache)

#### Trauma & Toxicology Red Flags
- Major trauma with suspected internal bleeding
- Suspected poisoning or overdose
- Severe burns (>10% body surface area)
- Suicidal ideation or self-harm risk

#### Pediatric-Specific Red Flags
- Infant fever (<3 months with temp >100.4°F / 38°C)
- Difficulty breathing in children
- Lethargy or inconsolability
- Severe dehydration (sunken fontanelle, no tears)

### 5.2 Escalation Action Protocol

When red flags are detected:

1. **IMMEDIATELY display prominent warning:**
   ```
   🚨 EMERGENCY INDICATORS DETECTED 🚨
   This situation may require IMMEDIATE medical attention.
   Recommended action: Seek emergency care NOW.
   Call [LOCAL EMERGENCY NUMBER] or go to nearest emergency department.
   ```

2. **Suppress non-urgent suggestions** (do not distract with differential diagnoses)

3. **Log escalation event** with timestamp and detected red flags

4. **If clinician is logged in:** Send immediate alert notification

5. **Provide location-aware guidance:**
   - Nearest emergency department (from local cache)
   - Emergency contact numbers (local)
   - Basic first aid instructions while waiting for help

### 5.3 Uncertainty Escalation

When confidence is low or conflicting information exists:

```
⚠️ UNCERTAIN ASSESSMENT
The system cannot confidently assess this situation based on available
information. Recommend clinical evaluation by a healthcare provider
for accurate assessment.
```

## 6. CONFIDENCE THRESHOLDS FOR AI SUGGESTIONS

### 6.1 Confidence Scoring System

All AI-generated suggestions MUST include a confidence score:

| Confidence Level | Score Range | Display | Action Required |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **High Confidence** | 80-100% | 🟢 High | "Strong match to known patterns" |
| **Moderate Confidence** | 50-79% | 🟡 Moderate | "Possible match, requires clinical correlation" |
| **Low Confidence** | 20-49% | 🟠 Low | "Weak match, consider alternatives" |
| **Very Low Confidence** | <20% | 🔴 Very Low | "Insufficient information for assessment" |

### 6.2 Display Requirements

**Minimum Information Display:**
- Confidence percentage (numeric)
- Confidence level (High/Moderate/Low/Very Low)
- Visual indicator (color-coded)
- Reasoning summary ("Based on: symptom X, Y, Z")
- Alternative possibilities (at least top 3)

**Example Output Format:**
```
Differential Diagnosis Support:

1. Condition A
   Confidence: 72% 🟡 Moderate
   Reasoning: Matches 4/6 key symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia)
   Missing: No chest X-ray findings reported

2. Condition B
   Confidence: 68% 🟡 Moderate
   Reasoning: Matches 3/5 key symptoms, patient age and history align

3. Condition C
   Confidence: 45% 🟠 Low
   Reasoning: Partial symptom match, but timeline inconsistent

⚠️ CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT NOTICE
[Standard disclaimer here]
```

### 6.3 Confidence Thresholds by Task

#### Diagnostic Suggestions
- **Minimum confidence to display:** 20%
- **Threshold for "strong consideration":** 60%
- **Always show top 3-5 possibilities** regardless of confidence
- **Flag when no suggestion exceeds 40%** → "Uncertain, recommend clinical evaluation"

#### Drug Interaction Warnings
- **Display ALL interactions** regardless of confidence
- **Severity classification:** Critical / Moderate / Minor
- **Err on the side of caution** (false positives acceptable, false negatives NOT)

#### Image Analysis Findings
- **Minimum confidence to highlight region:** 50%
- **Threshold for "likely abnormality":** 70%
- **Always flag low-confidence ambiguous findings** for radiologist review
- **Critical findings (fractures, masses):** Display at 40%+ with "requires specialist confirmation"

#### Triage Classification
- **Emergency classification:** Triggered by red-flag rules (not confidence-based)
- **Urgent vs. Routine:** 60% threshold for escalation
- **When uncertain:** Default to HIGHER acuity level (safer)

### 6.4 Confidence Calibration Rules

- **Never inflate confidence scores** to appear more certain
- **Penalize confidence when:**
  - Incomplete patient history
  - Conflicting symptoms
  - Rare conditions (lower prior probability)
  - Limited local knowledge base
- **Boost confidence when:**
  - Multiple independent information sources align
  - Classic textbook presentation
  - Supported by lab/imaging findings
- **NEVER exceed 95% confidence** for clinical suggestions (retain humility)

---

## 7. EXPLAINABILITY & AUDITABILITY REQUIREMENTS

### 7.1 Reasoning Transparency

Every AI output MUST include:
- **Input features considered** (symptoms, labs, history)
- **Decision pathway** (which model/agent generated this)
- **Supporting evidence** (literature references from local DB)
- **Alternative explanations considered**
- **Confidence rationale** (why this score)

### 7.2 Audit Trail

All AI interactions MUST be logged with:
- Timestamp
- User ID (clinician or patient)
- Agent invoked
- Input data (de-identified for storage)
- Output generated
- Confidence score
- Escalations triggered
- Clinician override actions

### 7.3 Human Override Tracking

When clinicians override AI suggestions:
- Log the override decision
- Capture clinician's rationale (optional free-text)
- Use for future model improvement (offline, privacy-preserving)

---

## 8. OFFLINE-SPECIFIC SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

### 8.1 Knowledge Base Staleness
- **Display last update date** of local medical knowledge base
- **Warn when knowledge >6 months old:** "Local database may not reflect latest guidelines"
- **Flag when missing critical drug information:** "Drug not in local database, consult pharmacist"

### 8.2 Model Limitations
- **Disclose model training cutoff date**
- **Warn about rare conditions:** "This condition may not be well-represented in training data"
- **Acknowledge diagnostic limitations:** "AI trained primarily on [specific populations/conditions]"

### 8.3 Connectivity-Dependent Features
- **Clearly mark features requiring internet:** "Referral directory requires internet connection"
- **Degrade gracefully:** Provide cached/offline alternatives
- **Never fail silently:** Alert users when features unavailable offline

---

## 9. PATIENT CONSENT & PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS

### 9.1 Data Collection Consent
- **Obtain explicit consent** before storing medical data
- **Explain data usage** (local storage, AI analysis, audit logs)
- **Allow granular control:** Patients can opt out of specific features
- **Provide data export/deletion** mechanisms

### 9.2 Access Controls
- **Role-based access:** Doctors, patients, admin have different permissions
- **Audit trail for all access** to patient records
- **Session timeouts** for security
- **Encryption at rest** for all medical data

### 9.3 De-identification for Analytics
- **Remove PII** before using data for model improvement
- **Aggregate statistics only** for system performance monitoring
- **No re-identification possible** from stored analytics data

---

## 10. SYSTEM LIMITATIONS DISCLOSURE

### The system MUST clearly communicate:

- "This system is trained on general medical knowledge and may not account for individual patient complexity"
- "AI cannot replicate the nuanced clinical judgment of experienced physicians"
- "Physical examination findings cannot be assessed through this system"
- "The system has no liability or legal responsibility for medical outcomes"
- "Healthcare providers retain full professional and legal responsibility for patient care"

---

## 11. TESTING & VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

Before deploying any agent:

1. **Red-flag detection accuracy:** Test on known emergency cases (100% recall required)
2. **False positive tolerance:** Acceptable for safety-critical warnings
3. **Confidence calibration:** Validate on held-out medical cases
4. **Disclaimer injection:** Verify all outputs include appropriate warnings
5. **Escalation workflow:** Test with simulated emergency scenarios
6. **Accessibility:** Ensure disclaimers readable at 8th-grade level

---

## 12. COMPETITION & JUDGE COMMUNICATION

### Key Messages for Judges:

1. **Safety-First Design:** Every design decision prioritizes patient safety over feature richness
2. **Humble AI:** The system acknowledges limitations and uncertainty
3. **Clinician-Centric:** AI augments, never replaces, human expertise
4. **Ethical Offline AI:** Privacy-preserving, locally owned medical data
5. **Real-World Applicability:** Designed for low-resource, low-connectivity environments
6. **Regulatory Awareness:** Structured as CDSS, not autonomous diagnostic device

---

## 13. ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### 13.1 Code-Level Guardrails
- **Safety agent** reviews all outputs before display
- **Keyword filters** detect prohibited language ("you have", "definitely", "certainly")
- **Confidence validators** reject outputs without scores
- **Disclaimer injector** wraps all medical content

### 13.2 Runtime Monitoring
- **Hallucination detection:** Flag nonsensical medical claims
- **Consistency checks:** Cross-validate agent outputs
- **Timeout safeguards:** Escalate when AI cannot decide quickly

### 13.3 Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints
- **Critical findings require clinician acknowledgment** before proceeding
- **High-risk actions (medication changes) require explicit confirmation**
- **Emergency escalations cannot be dismissed without override justification**

---
